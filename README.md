## Project Description

The Blog app is a classic example of a blog website. I created a fully functional website that will show the list of posts and empower readers to interact with them by adding comments and liking posts. It is also furnished with user management using the devise gem and api integration interface to enable developers plug in easily and use with different front-end.
